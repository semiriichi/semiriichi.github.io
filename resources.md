### Riichi Mahjong Club Map

If you are not local to our club and interested in seeing if there is a club in your area, you can [consult a list of clubs here.](https://jellicodemahjong.wordpress.com/world-riichi-map/) This map may not be fully up-to-date, but it is the most up-to-date one we know of.

### Terminology lists

Riichi mahjong is a game with a significant amount of terminology to learn. American players tend to use English and Japanese terminology interchangeably, though more experienced players tend to use Japanese terminology primarily, as it is often more succinct and precise than the translated terms. A list of common terms can be found on [the riichi wiki](https://riichi.wiki/List_of_terminology_by_alphabetical_order), and a more extensive list can be found on [the mahjong-ny website.](http://mahjong-ny.com/features/terminology/)

### Riichi Book 1

Written by Daina Chiba as a guide to help European riichi players strengthen their fundamentals, [Riichi Book 1](https://github.com/dainachiba/RiichiBooks/raw/master/RiichiBook1.pdf) is the most frequently recommended resource for beginner players. If you don't plan on playing on Tenhou.net, skip the first two chapters and start on chapter 3. While not the be-all and end-all of riichi strategy, most players agree that Riichi Book 1 covers the basics of the game that every player should (eventually) be familiar with.

### Efficiency trainer

The [efficiency trainer](https://euophrys.itch.io/mahjong-efficiency-trainer) is a browser application that tests your ability to make decisions that allow you to reach tenpai in the fewest number of turns. This program is useful for building an intuition for tile efficiency, but note that efficiency is only one of several considerations when it comes to riichi skill and strategy. 

### G-Uzaku's Tile Efficiency

[This translated version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ApHp2Dm-3dkEQTEAnmfTsk8J6OaH8d4G/view) of G-Uzaku's book on tile efficiency is a good resource for further honing your riichi hand-building strategy once you are finished with Riichi Book 1. Though it is an intermediate-level book, the presentation is accessible and it is divided into many short "lessons" rather than long chapters.

### Super Digital Mahjong

[Super Digital Mahjong](https://natsuai.com/mahjong/digital/) by Japanese pro player Kobayashi G≈ç is another intermediate-level resource covering riichi strategy with a focus on so-called "digital" play -- a mahjong philosophy that prioritizes making decisions based on sound understanding of the statistics and probability involved rather than playing by intuition or feel.
