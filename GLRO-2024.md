## Rules

## Food and Lodging

**Food:** Water, coffee, and snacks will be provided. This event will not be catered, but there are a number of lunch options nearby the venue.

**Lodging:** There are several affordable hotel options around the venue and in Ann Arbor. We recommend comparing rates before making a decision -- noting that rideshare in this area isn't too expensive.

## Prizes

**Cash prize:** If we hit the 64 entrant cap, we plan to offer $500 in cash prizes, split 200/150/100/50 for first through fourth. If we end up under the cap, this amount will be adjusted accordingly.

**Awards:** Trophies for first through fourth place, and conditionally (if we hit the player cap) medals for fifth through eigth place. Additional swag is planned.

## Tournament Format and Schedule

**Format:** 7 hanchan scramble followed by a top 4 cut. Top 4 will play a two hanchan final bracket, while all other players continue with two more games of scramble to determine final placements of fifth and lower.
