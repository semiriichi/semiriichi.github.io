Riichi mahjong is a variant of mahjong created and popularized in Japan. Mahjong is a family of tile-based games where the goal is to create a winning hand containing specific combinations of tiles, either by drawing them from the tile wall or by calling them from other players. Mahjong shares some similarities with rummy games, and if you've played rummy before the goal of creating runs and sets may already be familiar to you. Riichi mahjong involves an engaging mix of luck, strategy, and skill, and if it sounds interesting to you, please read on and learn a little more about the game!

### Brief history

Mahjong was developed in China in the 19th century. There are a number of Chinese mahjong variants, including Chinese classical mahjong, Sichuan mahjong, and Hong Kong/Cantonese mahjong. In the 1920s, mahjong was imported to the United States (by way of an oil company representative who played while living in China) and to Japan (by way of a soldier named Saburo Hirayama). The American variant was eventually standardized in 1935 when the rules were simplified and codified, and is now commonly referred to as *Mah-jongg*. In Japan, Hirayama started a mahjong club, parlor, and school in Tokyo. The rules for Japanese mahjong were initially simplified and then later made more complex before it evolved into modern riichi mahjong. This process of evolution also involved the creation of a number of regional variants.

Riichi mahjong is now the most popular table game in Japan, with millions of players and thousands of parlors (*jansou*). Japan also has a professional riichi mahjong scene, where professional players are part of a handful of mahjong organizations and participate in league play. This elevation of mahjong to the level of sport  provides an alternative view on a game that tends to have a strong association with gambling in Japan, though of course, many do play for money, especially in jansou.

Recently, riichi mahjong has been increasing in popularity outside Japan in part due to its depiction in anime/manga (especially Saki and Akagi) and in video games (such as Final Fantasy XIV and Yakuza). Accessible online platforms for playing riichi mahjong, such as Mahjong Soul, have also contributed to its increasing popularity.
