title: What is Riichi Mahjong?

Riichi mahjong is a variant of mahjong created and popularized in Japan. Mahjong is a family of tile-based games where the goal is to create a winning hand containing specific combinations of tiles, either by drawing them from the tile wall or by calling them from other players. Mahjong shares some similarities with rummy games, and if you've played rummy before the goal of creating runs and sets may already be familiar to you. Riichi mahjong involves an engaging mix of luck, strategy, and skill, and if it sounds interesting to you, please read on and learn a little more about the game (or just jump in and try it).

### Brief cultural context

Mahjong was developed in China in the 19th century. There are a number of Chinese mahjong variants, including Chinese classical mahjong, Sichuan mahjong, and Hong Kong/Cantonese mahjong. In the 1920s, mahjong was imported to the United States (by way of an oil company representative who played while living in China) and to Japan (by way of a soldier named Saburo Hirayama). The American variant was eventually standardized in 1935 when the rules were simplified and codified, and is now commonly referred to as *Mah-jongg*. In Japan, Hirayama started a mahjong club, parlor, and school in Tokyo. The rules for Japanese mahjong were initially simplified and then later made more complex before it evolved into modern riichi mahjong. This process of evolution also involved the creation of a number of regional variants.

Riichi mahjong is now the most popular table game in Japan, with millions of players and thousands of parlors (*jansou*). Japan also has a professional riichi mahjong scene, where professional players are part of a handful of mahjong organizations and participate in league play. This elevation of mahjong to the level of sport  provides an alternative view on a game that tends to have a strong association with gambling in Japan, though of course, many do play for money, especially in jansou.

Recently, riichi mahjong has been increasing in popularity outside Japan in part due to its depiction in anime/manga (especially Saki and Akagi) and in video games (such as Final Fantasy XIV and Yakuza). Accessible online platforms for playing riichi mahjong, such as Mahjong Soul, have also contributed to its increasing popularity. 

### Playing the game

A standard game of riichi mahjong starts with four players shuffling a set of 136 tiles, then arranging them into a set of four "walls" two tiles high and 17 tiles long. After placing the walls, the first dealer rolls a pair of dice to determine where the tile wall is broken, then each player takes tiles until they have 13 tiles as their starting hand. Seven tile stacks (14 tiles total) are marked for a special purpose and are known as the "dead wall," and the remaining 70 tiles form the playing wall, where players draw from. Players then begin drawing tiles from the wall, starting with the dealer and moving counterclockwise, discarding a tile each time so that their hand remains at 13 tiles. Discards are placed in an ordered fashion, as required by the rules (using your opponents' discards to glean information about their hand is also an important element of strategy).

The set of tiles includes tiles of 34 types, with 4 tiles of each type. The 34 types of tiles are shown below, and consist of three suits of tiles numbered one through nine and then seven types of "honor" tiles.

![The tiles of riichi mahjong](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/semiriichi/semiriichi.github.io/master/images/about-riichi/riichi_tiles.png)

- First row: Character tiles (*Manzu*): one through nine (including a special red 5-man)
- Second row: Dot tiles (*Pinzu*): one through nine (including a special red 5-pin)
- Third row: Bamboo tiles (*Souzu*): one through nine (including a special red 5-sou)
- Fourth row: Wind tiles: East (*Ton*), South (*Nan*), West (*Shaa*), North (*Pei*); then Dragon tiles: Red (*Chun*), White (*Haku*), Green (*Hatsu*)

In each round of play, players will attempt to win a hand. To win their hand, a player needs to complete four groups (*Mentsu*) and one head (*Atama*, also commonly just called a pair). Groups come in three forms:

- **Run/sequence** (*Shuntsu*): A set of three consecutive numbered tiles. For example, 1-pin, 2-pin, and 3-pin, or 4-sou, 5-sou and 6-sou. Does not wrap around (in the standard ruleset).
- **Set/triplet** (*Koutsu*): A set of three identical tiles.
- **Quad** (*Kantsu*): A set of four identical tiles. Kans operate by special rules so that they are only counted as 3 tiles in the hand, and have other special properties as well. 

In addition to having four complete groups and one head, a player must also have at least one *yaku* to win a hand. See the next section for a short discussion of yaku.

A player attempting to form groups and advance their hand only by drawing and discarding tiles is said to have a **closed** hand (*Menzen*). In order to speed up their hand progression, a player may choose to **open** their hand by calling tiles from other players. The two most common calls are:

- ***Chii***: A call to use a tile just discarded by our left player (*Kamicha*) to complete a run in our hand. For example, if we have a 5-pin and 7-pin tile in our hand and our kamicha discards a 6-pin tile, we may call chii on that tile.
- ***Pon***: A call to use a tile just discarded by any player to complete a set in our hand. E.g., if we have two haku tiles, we may call pon on a haku that was just discarded to complete a set of haku.

Chii and pon calls are made vocally by saying "chii" or "pon" upon seeing the discard. If you call pon, the general rule is that you must do so before the next player draws a tile into their hand. Pon takes priority over chii if both calls are made on the same discard. Called groups are set aside from your hand, face up and visible to other players (hence "open" hand). The upside of calling is that you can ensure you complete a group without having to rely on the luck of the draw. The downside of calling is that open hands have a significantly reduced number of available yaku, narrowing the ways you can win the hand. Note that there are also three variants of the ***Kan*** call, which forms groups of four tiles. See a more thorough game introduction for the rules for calling kan.
