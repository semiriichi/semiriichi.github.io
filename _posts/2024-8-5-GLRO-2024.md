After much discussion and planning, SEMI will be hosting our first tournament this Fall in Saline, MI on October 19-20! 
Officially approved by the American Riichi Association, our tournament will offer a chance to win ARA qualifier points -- 
but don't worry if you don't know what those are, because it's also a chance to have fun and face off some of the 
US's strongest players in a competitive setting that is still welcome to players with a broad range of skill levels. 
Attendance is currently capped at 64 players, with a $50 entry fee to cover overhead. 

Please check out [the event page](https://semiriichi.github.io/GLRO-2024/) for more details.
