    SEMI is a riichi mahjong club based in Ann Arbor and the Greater Detroit Area with meetups happening in Ann Arbor (on the U of M campus), Livonia, Royal Oak, and Detroit (on the Wayne State University Campus). All meetups are open to the public and being an enrolled student is not required.

    We are one of the longest continually operating clubs in the US, starting with some like minded people getting together in Plymouth in 2009. Since then our focus has largely remained on casual, fun mahjong, but if you desire tournaments and competitve mahjong, many members attend several tournaments a year and can assist in improving your game. In 2024, we successfully held the first Great Lakes Riichi Open (GLRO) and hope to invite the community back to play yearly!
