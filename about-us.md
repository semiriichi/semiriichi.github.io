Our group was founded in 2009, the year the anime Saki came out. Not coincidentally, this is how many of us found riichi to begin with! We started out small and met up in various locations over the years across all of southeast Michigan, before eventually settling mostly in Ann Arbor, home of the university of Michigan, and we also have a group who meets in Livonia. We meet both in person and online, so if you aren't local to us and want a group to play with, you're very welcome!

Most of us just play for fun, but some of us have quite high mahjong aspirations. Many of us are in the American Riichi Mahjong League and we represent all levels there, from B3-A1. We have players ranging in skill from still learning the game to World Riichi convention intvitees. We welcome players of all levels, including people who have never played!
