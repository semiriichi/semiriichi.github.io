Southeast Miichigan Riichi was founded in 2009, the year the mahjong anime Saki came out. Not coincidentally, this is how many of us learned about riichi to begin with! We started out small and met up in various locations over the years across all of southeast Michigan, before eventually settling on an Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti meetup (where we play on the University of Michigan campus) and a Livonia meetup for folks who live in Detroit. We meet both in person and online, so if you aren't local to us and want a group to play with, you're very welcome!

Most of our members just play for fun and to socialize, but some of us enjoy the competitive side of the game and have quite high mahjong aspirations. A number of us participate in the relatively new American Riichi Mahjong League and we represent all levels there, from divisions B3 to A1. Additionally, some of our members (and former members) are regulars at a variety of U.S. riichi mahjong tournaments, such as NYC's Riichi Nomi Open and the Pacific Mahjong League Open. Our meetups always have people ranging in skill from still learning the game to World Riichi Championship invitees. 

Most of our club activity happens on our Discord server, and our online nights (where we play on Mahjong Soul) are also organized there, so if you're interested in our club, please click **Join** on the right side of the navigation bar! We welcome players of all experience levels, including people who have never played (or folks who have only played other mahjong variants, like Hong Kong or American mahjong). All you need is a willingness to learn a new game and a good attitude. We hope to see you at our next meetup.
