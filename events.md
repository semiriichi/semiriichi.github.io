### [Great Lakes Riichi Open 2024](https://semiriichi.github.io/GLRO-2024/)

Join us in Saline, MI on October 19-20, 2024 for the Great Lakes Riichi Open! See the linked event page for more details.

### Youmacon 2023

We're back at [Youmacon](https://www.youmacon.com/) (November 2 - 5) this year in an official capacity! We'll have a number of teaching and freeplay tables set up in the Tabletop games room starting Friday evening and continuing through the end of the con. Note that the Tabletop games room is in Huntington Place (aka TCF center, aka Cobo hall) this year, rather than in the GM Ren cen, and therefore is not 24 hours like normal. We will also be hosting a introduction to riichi mahjong panel on Saturday morning, so come check that out too! More info available in the Youma 2023 post.

### Youmacon 2022

[Youmacon](https://www.youmacon.com/) (November 3 - 6) is a convention that falls on Halloween weekend every year for all things geeky, from tabletop games and video games to anime to Disney and Marvel, and it's our group's home con. Every year at Youmacon we set up in the games room and in the past we have even run a Mahjong 101 panel. This year, our plan is to play in the large atrium of the GM Renaissance Center (commonly referred to as the Wintergarden) along with our friends from other nearby groups, such as the Chicago and Grand Rapids clubs. This won't require a convention badge, so we're hoping it's acessible to as many folks as possible. Don't be shy if you see us playing there; all are welcome, and the more the merrier.
