### Youmacon 2022

<a href="https://www.youmacon.com/">Youmacon</a> (November 3-6, 2022) is an anime convention for all things geeky, from tabletop games to anime to Disney and Marvel, and it's our group's home con. Every year at Youmacon we set up in the games room and in the past we have even run a Mahjong 101 panel. This year we'll be playing with our group, along with others from nearby mahjong clubs such as Chicago. Don't be shy if you see us in the tabletop games room! All are welcome and the more the merrier.
