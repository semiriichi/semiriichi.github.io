### Youmacon 2022

[Youmacon](https://www.youmacon.com/) (November 3 - 6, 2022) is a convention that falls on Halloween weekend every year for all things geeky, from tabletop games and video games to anime to Disney and Marvel, and it's our group's home con. Every year at Youmacon we set up in the games room and in the past we have even run a Mahjong 101 panel. This year, our plan is to play in the large atrium of the GM Renaissance Center (commonly referred to as the Wintergarden) along with our friends from other nearby groups, such as the Chicago and Grand Rapids clubs. This won't require a convention badge, so we're hoping it's acessible to as many folks as possible. Don't be shy if you see us playing there; all are welcome, and the more the merrier.
