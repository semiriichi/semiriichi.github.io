**Lodging:** There are several affordable hotel options around the venue and in Ann Arbor. We recommend comparing rates before making a decision -- noting that rideshare in this area isn't too expensive.

**Cash prize:** If we hit the 64 entrant cap, we plan to offer $500 in cash prizes, split 200/150/100/50 for 1st through 4th place. If we end up under the cap, this amount will be adjusted accordingly.

**Awards:** Trophies for 1st through 4th place, and conditionally (50+ players) medals for 5th through 8th place. Additional swag is planned.

## Tournament Format and Schedule

**Format:** 7 hanchan scramble followed by a top 4 cut. Top 4 will play a two hanchan final bracket, while all other players continue with two additional games of scramble to determine final placements of 5th and lower.
